# 1 - Requirements

You need the following softwares to run *Pimp my Log* :

* A web server (*Apache*, *NGINX*,*lighttpd*, *IIS*, ...)
* At least PHP version 5.2
* Log files readable from the web server

That's all ! No database, no dependencies, ...


# 2 - Installation

## 2.1 - From GIT repository

{% include documentation_install_git.md %}

### Beta

As it stands, there are two branches of interest:

- `master`: this reflects tagged stable releases as found in the *.tar.gz* or *.zip* downloads. Use this if you want a stable system.
- `beta`: the branch under active development. Use this if you want the latest but possibly unstable updates.

> **Warning**  
>
> Avoid switching from a branch to an other because the configuration file is only upgraded and never downgraded. So you could have a *master* code with a *beta* configuration file...

<!-- -->

To install the *beta* version, clone the beta branch from the repository (`git clone {{ site.data.github.git }} -b beta`) instead of the full repository. In the configuration file, change the `PIMPMYLOG_VERSION_URL` as explained [here](/documentation/configuration.html?pimpmylog_version_url) to check for *beta* updates.


### Update

To update *Pimp My Log*, simply go to the root directory and pull the code :

```sh
$ cd /var/www/html/PimpMyLog
$ git pull
```

User files are defined in the `.gitignore` file and are not overridden.


## 2.2 - With composer

{% include documentation_install_composer.md %}

### Customizations

When installing with composer, all user custom files are located in the root directory of composer and not in the root directory of *Pimp My Log* as it is with other installation ways.

```
/composer.json
/composer.lock
/config.auth.user.php     <-- Authentication database
/config.user.d/...        <-- Pimp My Log secondary configuration files
/config.user.php          <-- Pimp My Log main configuration file
/css/
/css/config.inc.user.css  <-- Custom CSS file
/vendor/
/vendor/potsky/
/vendor/potsky/pimp-my-log/
/vendor/potsky/pimp-my-log/index.php
```

### Versions

Install the latest stable version:

```
composer require "potsky/pimp-my-log"
```

Install the latest pseudo stable version (not still released officially):

```
composer require "potsky/pimp-my-log" "dev-master"
```

Install a specific version:

```
composer require "potsky/pimp-my-log" "v1.6.2"
```

Install a specific major version:

```
composer require "potsky/pimp-my-log" "~1"
```

Install the beta unstable version:

```
composer require "potsky/pimp-my-log" "dev-beta"
```

### Update

Just do it:

```
composer update
```

## 2.3 - From archive

{% include documentation_install_zip.md %}

<a name="update"></a>

### Update

You **must** backup your configuration files before updating:

```sh
$ destination="/tmp/PimpMyLog-backup"
$ mkdir -p $destination/{css,cfg}
$ cd /var/www/html/PimpMyLog
$ for file in config.user.d config.user.json config.user.php css/*.user.css cfg/*.user.php; do
    cp -rf $file $destination/$file
done;
```

- [Download](https://github.com/potsky/PimpMyLog/zipball/master) the *Pimp My Log* archive
- Extract
- Replace all backed up files as in the installation process


# 3 - First configuration

At the first launch, if you have not configured manually *Pimp My Log*, the configurator will be displayed. In most of case, you will just have to click on *Ok* or *Continue* buttons.

{% image /assets/ss/getstarted_install1.png class="img-responsive" alink="" atarget="" %}

{% image /assets/ss/getstarted_install2.png class="img-responsive" alink="" atarget="" %}

{% image /assets/ss/getstarted_install3.png class="img-responsive" alink="" atarget="" %}

Click on the *Configure now* button.

> **Note**  
> 
> The configurator will try to detect your current web server and select by default logs for it.  
> It tries to detect some PHP special logs too.  
> You can manually select other softwares.  

*Pimp My Log* configurator supports :

- *Apache* :
    - *NCSA* log formats
- *IIS* :
    - *IIS* log format
    - *NCSA* log format
    - *W3C Extended* log format with custom fields
- *NGINX* :
    - default log formats
- *PHP* :
    - default log formats generated by setting the `error_log` ini parameter

<!-- -->

{% image /assets/ss/getstarted_install4.png class="img-responsive" alink="" atarget="" %}

{% image /assets/ss/getstarted_install5.png class="img-responsive" alink="" atarget="" %}

The configurator will look for log files in common locations and will show you all log files found. They are all selected by default but you can select which files you want. If *Pimp My Log* cannot find log files while your are sure that there are in a common location:

- please read the next paragraph
- open a ticket on [support.pimpmylog.com](http://support.pimpmylog.com) and specify:
    - your operating system
    - your server type and version and how you have installed it (package manager, manually, etc...)
    - where are located your server log files

You can also specify custom paths in textareas below for:

- error logs
- access logs

Click on the *Continue* button.

Got it! Your *Pimp My Log* instance is configured and ready to use. Click on the *Pimp my Logs now!* button.

# 4 - Read access

*Pimp My Log* needs a read access to log files you want to display. So log files have to be reached by your web server user. In the following example, let :

- `apache` be the web server user on an UNIX system
- `/var/log/httpd/access_log` be the path of the apache access log file

Then the command (ran as *root* on the server) `sudo -u apache ls /var/log/httpd/access_log` must return `/var/log/httpd/access_log` and not an error.

If this command fails, the webserver user has not access to the log file and *Pimp My Log* will not be able to read it.

Don't forget that to read file `/var/log/httpd/access_log`, these directories must be reachable (flag `x` in a *chmod*) by the web server user :

- `/var/log/httpd/`
- `/var/log/`
- `/var/`
- `/`

If you change log files access via a *chmod* command and lose these changes after several hours, days, ... verify that *logrotate* (or similar rotation log system) is well configured! There is an option in *logrotate* to set default rights on the new files.
