Hi folks!

long time no see!

Version 1.1 is finally released with a useful feature when working on large set of logs : **Markers**. Click on the date and the line will be marked during your current session. Go to the settings and click on the `clear markers` button to clear all current markers.

This version also adds a new language : *portugese do brasil* tribute to *FIFA 2014*.

It finally adds a better support for copy/paste rows and especially for Firefox users.
