Hi folks!

This new version gives you the ability to split user configuration in several files.

In the backstage, I have rewritten a lot of things for the next upcoming version 1.5. A lot of features are on the road...

---

There is a new `USER_CONFIGURATION_DIR` global configuration parameter.

You can split your files configuration file in several parts. `config.user.json` is mandatory and you can add files parts in several files in a folder. By default, this folder is named `config.user.d`  and is next to `config.user.json` file. But you can change the location. Changing this folder is useful if you have several *Pimp my Log* instances on the same server and want to share some configurations.

All files are recursively parsed in this folder and in its all sub-folders.

Only files with `json` extension are parsed.

Here is `config.user.d/httpd.json` for example :

```
{
    "apache1": {
        "display" : "Apache Error #1",
        "path"    : "\/var\/log\/apache2\/error.log",
        "refresh" : 5,
        "max"     : 10,
        "notify"  : true,
        "format"  : {
            "type" : "HTTPD 2.2",
            "regex": "|^\\[(.*)\\] \\[(.*)\\] (\\[client (.*)\\] )*((?!\\[client ).*)(, referer: (.*))*$|U",
            "match": {
                "Date"     : 1,
                "IP"       : 4,
                "Log"      : 5,
                "Severity" : 2,
                "Referer"  : 7
            },
            "types": {
                "Date"     : "date:H:i:s",
                "IP"       : "ip:http",
                "Log"      : "pre",
                "Severity" : "badge:severity",
                "Referer"  : "link"
            },
            "exclude": {
                "Log": ["\/PHP Stack trace:\/", "\/PHP *[0-9]*\\. \/"]
            }
        }
    }
}
```
