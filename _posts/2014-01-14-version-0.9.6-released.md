This version includes both very cool new features:

- Multi-line
- Fields concatenation

<!--more-->

#### 1. Multi-line

Multi-line log files are now supported. I mean files which contain logs where the last field can be written on several lines or which contains the `\n` char.  

This is supported:

```
[27-11-2013:23:20:40 +0100] This is an error
on several lines
[27-11-2013:23:20:41 +0100] Single line is cool too
```

not this:

```
--c7036611-F--
Protocol: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
--c7036611-H--
Message: Warning. Match of "rx ^apache.*perl" against
--c7036611-Z--
...
```


#### 2. Fields concatenation

2. The `match` array has replaced its *seperator* feature by a *concatenator*! You can now display any field how you want in any column.

This fixes some bug of course.

*Pimp My Log* is on the final straight!
