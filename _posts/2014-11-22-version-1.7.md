Hi folks!

you can now install *Pimp My Log* with composer. 

<div class="alert alert-danger">If you have installed a previous version with composer (>1.6.2), YOU NEED TO BACKUP YOUR CONFIGURATION FILES MANUALLY, they will be lost when you will launch a `composer update`.</div>

### Customizations

When installing with composer, all user custom files are located in the root directory of composer and not in the root directory of *Pimp My Log* as it is with other installation ways.

```
/composer.json
/composer.lock
/config.auth.user.php     <-- Authentication database
/config.user.d/...        <-- Pimp My Log secondary configuration files
/config.user.php          <-- Pimp My Log main configuration file
/css/
/css/config.inc.user.css  <-- Custom CSS file
/vendor/
/vendor/potsky/
/vendor/potsky/pimp-my-log/
/vendor/potsky/pimp-my-log/index.php
```
