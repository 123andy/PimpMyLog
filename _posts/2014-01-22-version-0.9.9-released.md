This bulky update includes versions `0.9.8` and `0.9.9`. It includes several improvements and bug fixes.

The new `TITLE_FILE` global parameter let you customize the page title according to the current displayed file. It is really handy when you have several *Pimp My Log* instances in several tabs.

Are you ok to release version 1.0.0 in a few days? Still some annoying bugs?
