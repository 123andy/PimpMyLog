*PHP Apache Log Viewer* now becomes *Pimp My Log*. *Pimp My Log* is in beta until mid-January and will be released in version 1.0.

<!--more-->

Why this change ?

*PHP Apache Log Viewer* was a simple buggy script.

*Pimp My Log* is an *enterprise class* log viewer.


I am writing the documentation to let you install, use and extend *Pimp My Log* easily. During this period, let me know if you encounter some problems to install or use *Pimp My Log* via the [support page](http://support.pimpmylog.com) or by [email](support@pimpmylog.com)

Have fun!
