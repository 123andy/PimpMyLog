#### Pimp my What ???

*Pimp my Log* is a web app written in *PHP*. It displays server logs friendly.

Formerly named *PHP Apache Log Viewer*, it has been renamed because any kind of logs can be displayed now.  
Basically, you will surely display your *Apache*, *NGINX*, *IIS* or *PHP logs*, but *Ruby on Rails*, *Tomcat*, *sshd*, *syslog*, *CakePHP*, ... too !

By default, *Pimp My Log* supports :

- *Apache* web server
- *NGINX* web server
- *IIS* web server
- *PHP* log files

You can find other log formats on the [support](http://support.pimpmylog.com) site.
