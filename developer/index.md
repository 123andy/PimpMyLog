There is essentially three ways to contribute to *Pimp My Log* :

- Add new type of logs for new softwares (want to display logs from *sshd*, *nginx*, ...)
- Add some new features, fix bugs, etc... in the main source code
- Add a new language

# New logs

## For your own usage

Basically, you just have to modify the configuration file `config.user.json` at root and it will work. To understand how the configuration file works, just read the [documentation about configuration](/documentation/configuration.html), it is easy.

The only difficulty should be the regular expression. There is a tool to help you to find the right expression. This tool is explained in the [debug](/developer/debug.html) page.

## For the community

First of all, you have to make it work for you! This is the most difficult part.

Then you have share it with the community by adding some stuffs so that users will enable this new software during the auto-configuration process at first launch.

You should read both pages [log-format](/developer/log-format.html) and [software-format](/developer/software-format.html) to understand how you can build your software configurator.

As soon as you have built both files `cfg/my_awesome_software.config.php` and `cfg/my_awesome_software.paths.php`, you can send us these files via the [support site](http://support.pimpmylog.com) and we will include them in a next release.

# Active development

If you want to add new features, fix some bugs or something else, it is easy :

- Fork the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/potsky/PimpMyLog/fork)
- Work in the `dev` or `jekyll` branch (see below)
- Commit
- Push
- Click on the *New pull request* on your forked repository in your account 
- Add some comments to your modifications if they are not trivial to understand

Got it!

## Structure

You have to understand how the repository is organized at first. *Pimp My Log* has 5 branches:

- `master`: the production code
- `beta`: the code in preproduction to test on live before going to prod
- `dev`: the development branch, **you code here**
- `gh-pages`: hey this is the static website you are reading now!
- `jekyll`: the development branch for the `gh-pages`, **you write documentation here**

### Code

To code in *Pimp My Log*, checkout the `dev` branch:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/potsky/PimpMyLog.git -b dev PimpMyLog-dev
$ cd PimpMyLog-dev
```

Install some tools:

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

And launch `grunt` to watch your modifications and rebuild what is necessary:

```sh
$ grunt
```

Your *Pimp My Log* development instance is now available at <http://localhost/PimpMyLog-dev/_site/>

You need of course *PHP* on your local server!

When you are ready, test your code in production. Stop `grunt` and launch the production server now:

```sh
$ grunt build
```

Your *Pimp My Log* development instance ready for production is now available at <http://localhost/PimpMyLog-dev/_build/>

This code will be the same as in the `master` branch :

- less files converted to a single css minified file
- javascripts in a single file minified
- licences added
- version checked
- ...

### Documentation

To work on the documentation is really funny in my private opinion. The website that you are reading now is a static website without any database or script language. It is based on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It is served by *Github* servers but **statically** because plugins are great and *Github* does not allow them.

So the website in the *gh-pages* is already generated by `grunt` in the `jekyll` branch.

You will need these tools on your computer:

- [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (`npm install -g grunt-cli`)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/) (`npm install -g bower`)
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (`gem install jekyll`)
- [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org) (`port install GraphicsMagick`)

To write documentation or fix my poor english words on *pimpmylog.com*, checkout the `jekyll` branch:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/potsky/PimpMyLog.git -b jekyll PimpMyLog-jekyll
$ cd PimpMyLog-jekyll
```

Install some tools:

```sh
$ bundle install
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

In 2 terminals, run at the same time :

- `grunt` to watch for file modification and live rebuild
- `grunt server` to launch Jekyll in dev mode with watch for file modification and live rebuild

Now you can watch the documentation website at <http://localhost:4000>.

Here is the file structure :

- `_js` : our javascripts
- `_css` : our css and less files
- `assets` : the static assets directory
- `upload` : assets for posts (thumbnails are computed on grunt processes)

Install new css and js tools with `bower install ... -S` and do not modify original files in `bower-components`!

When you have finished and are ready, test your modification in production. Stop both grunt processes and launch:

```sh
$ grunt build server-prod
```

Now you can watch the production documentation website ready to deploy at <http://localhost:4000>.

As in the `dev` branch, this will minify css, js, html, build thumbnails, etc...

# New language

If you want to add you favourite language in *Pimp My Log* (not the documentation website), download the [po template](https://raw.github.com/potsky/PimpMyLog/master/lang/messages.po) file and load it with [PoEdit](http://www.poedit.net/download.php) for example. Translate it and send it via the [support site](http://support.pimpmylog.com), we will include it in a next release.
